FakeSequence - An artificial non-functional realistic DNA sequence generator.

DESCRIPTION

FakeSequence is an artificial non-functional realistic DNA sequence generator.

Why do we need it? Because with current sequencing technology we can sequence 
any organism and start mining the genome. Many genomic analysis use strong 
statistical tests, but until now, a good negative control has never developed.

For example, we can use several programs (Genscan, Augustus, GlimmerHMM, ...) 
to predict coding genes, all these programs has been properly trained to 
recognize how a gene looks like using well characterized genes. So you expect a
low false negative rate, but none implements a negative control therefore you
will find a lot of false positive genes. This is currently true in many model 
organisms (including human) where the number of predicted coding genes are more 
than the number of coding genes with evidence. Of course you can use intergenic 
regions as a negative control, but these regions are limited in number and size,
also you cannot be 100% sure that the regions don't contain genes.

So, we developed this new tool to recreate realistic sequences based on the 
properties of the background genome. We define the background genome as the
remained sequences of a genome after removal of genes (coding and non-coding),
pseudogenes, interspersed repeats and low complexity sequences (700 Mb in hg19).

We modeled: 
(1) composition of the background genome
(2) interspersed repeats
(3) low complexity sequences
(4) pseudogenes?

The current algorithm creates a base sequence, then the sequence is bombarded
with artificially evolved elements (repeats, low complexity, pseudogenes) as
expected in the reference genome. The final output is a Fasta file with the 
new sequence generated.
