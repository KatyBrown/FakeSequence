FakeSequence - An artificial non-functional realistic DNA sequence generator.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

All the code is in Perl, so basically just unpack/clone the package in a
convenient directory and add/create the models under data/

a) Unpacking a TAR-ball
   > tar zxf fakesequence.tgz

b) Clonning the repository from GitHub:
   > git clone git://github.com/caballero/FakeSequence.git
   
Note: the GIT repository only contains the code, no models are included.   
   
REPBASE DATA

The RepBase consensus sequences can be obtained from GIRI 
[http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/index.php], download and unpack the
Fasta format of RepBase, then run parseRepBase.pl to create one Fasta file.
  
  > cd data/RepBase
  > tar zxvf /PATH/TO/RepBaseXXXX.fasta.tar.gz
  > ../../bin/parseRepBase.pl > RepBase.fa
  
  where XXXX is the version number of RepBase.

createFakeSequence.pl looks for "RepBase.fa", adjust the file name if
required in the code.

OTHER

The scripts must work out-of-the-box, but minor changes might be required:

1. Perl path: the default is /usr/bin/perl, change it in all scripts if
   required.
2. Perl modules: we use standard modules: [Getopt, Pod, File, List], please
   use CPAN if your perl version doesn't include them.
3. Data dir: default is './data', you can modified this value as a parameter
   or changing the variable $data in the scripts.
4. createModel.pl require 'wget' and 'tar', you can adjust the path or change
   the commands in the source code.

TESTING

Run bin/test.sh to check if the installation works, it will model and create
and artificial sequence using the Fugu genome.
