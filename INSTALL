INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

All the code is in Perl, so basically just unpack/clone the package in a
convenient directory and add/create the models under data/

a) Unpacking a TAR-ball
   > tar zxf fakesequence.tgz

b) Clonning the repository from GitHub:
   > git clone git://github.com/caballero/FakeSequence.git

The scripts must work out-of-the-box, but minor changes might be required:

1. Perl path: the default is /usr/bin/perl, change it in all scripts if
   required.
2. Perl modules: we use standard modules: [Getopt, Pod, File, List], please
   use CPAN if your perl version doesn't include them.
3. Data dir: default is './data', you can modified this value as a parameter
   or changing the variable $data in the scripts.
4. createModel.pl require 'wget' and 'tar', you can adjust the path or change
   the commands in the source code.

TESTING

Run bin/test.sh to check if the installation works, it will model and create
and artificial sequence using the Fugu genome.
